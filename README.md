## Other projects

# First year at Télécom Paris

SimTraffic, a project done in collaboration with Lysiane Burel, Ryuto Yokoyama, Clément Teytaud, Reuven Windisch, Mattéo Ratet, Zineb Bouharra and Louis Petitjean. I was tasked with the implementation of the interface (done in Java with Swing).

# Middle and high school

A draft of an RTS videogame I worked on during middle school as a personal project (done with GameMaker), and the beginning of a remake in C++ done during high school.
